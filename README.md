## Room for Improvement

- connect data input from "Add Task" to Calendar page in order to display which dates have assignments due
- cleaner interaction to delete a task (want to do a swipe to delete)
- organize list of assignments by algorithm that determines importance of assignment (based on date due, percentage worth, and level of difficulty)
- include data storage with profile/user
- Google calendar integrations
